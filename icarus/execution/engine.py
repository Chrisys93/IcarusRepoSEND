"""This module implements the simulation engine.

The simulation engine, given the parameters according to which a single
experiments needs to be run, instantiates all the required classes and executes
the experiment by iterating through the event provided by an event generator
and providing them to a strategy instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    topology : Topology
        The FNSS Topology object modelling the network topology on which
        experiments are run.
    workload : iterable
        An iterable object whose elements are (time, event) tuples, where time
        is a float type indicating the timestamp of the event to be executed
        and event is a dictionary storing all the attributes of the event to
        execute
    netconf : dict
        Dictionary of attributes to inizialize the network model
    strategy : tree
        Strategy definition. It is tree describing the name of the strategy
        to use and a list of initialization attributes
    cache_policy : tree
        Cache policy definition. It is tree describing the name of the cache
        policy to use and a list of initialization attributes
    collectors: dict
        The collectors to be used. It is a dictionary in which keys are the
        names of collectors to use and values are dictionaries of attributes
        for the collector they refer to.

    Returns
    -------
    results : Tree
        A tree with the aggregated simulation results from all collectors
