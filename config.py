"""This module contains all configuration information used to run simulations.

Overview
========

This reference configuration file is divided into two parts.
The first part lists generic simulation parameters such as number of processes
to use, logging configuration and so on.
The second part builds an "experiment queue", i.e. a queue of configuration
parameters each representing one single experiment.

Each element of the queue must be an instance of the icarus.util.Tree class,
which is an object modelling a tree of hierarchically organized configuration
parameters. Alternatively nested dictionaries can be used instead of trees. In
this case Icarus will convert them to trees at runtime. It is however suggested
to use Tree objects because they provide methods that simplify the definition
of experiments.  

Experiment definition syntax

This figure below represents the parameter structure accepted by Icarus:
